        About This Site
      </h2>
      <p>
        This has been hand-coded in pure html and css. I took a lot of inspiration
        from both my own past MySpace and GeoCities site, as well as modern artistic
        reinterpretations of the aestetic (see
        <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/" target="_blank">Cameron's World</a>).
        <br><br>
        Many of the GIFs were from there, which in turn came from the old web. I did
        occasionally lean on copilot for boilerplate and web programming
        advice, as I am quite rusty in this domain.

      <h2>
        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am me. In the words of Jenny Calendar from BTVS I might consider myself
        a techno-pagan. In real life I'm an engineer. But really, at the end of the
        day, I'm just a nostalgic millenial who misses her myspace page, and wants
        a safe circle for her, well, *circle*, to communicate and gather.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>
        I live in Norway, speak English, Norwegian, and Spanish, and spend my
        spare time writing, watching 90's re-runs (obviously), walking in the
        mountains, riding my bike, wearing pink on Wednesdays, and cooking
        delicious food.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>
        I've done a lot of things in my life. In the time I have left, I want to
        spend good, quality time with my friends, learn to (better) love myself,
        and find peace with the sadness around the people that have gone before me.
